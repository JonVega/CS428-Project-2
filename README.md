# CS428 Project 2 - AR Diorama

This project uses the Astronaut and Drone [Vuforia target markers](http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/428/20files/4%20mars%20markers.png)

Two Vuforia card markers were to provide an augmented reality diorama of my room in Japan before the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was to create a personal use of artificial reality at both life-size and tabletop scale, with the assumption that one day people would also interact with other dioramas through the use of lightweight glasses. This could also be expanded through the use of digital assets to customize their diorama to showcase their personality, or recreate an experience.
